I am currently on the job market for both industry and academic positions. I always appreciate a chat about opportunities or chances to collaborate.

I am an interdisciplinary researcher whose work investigates how computational systems and human experience co-evolve through the lens of embodied interaction. My research examines how technologies are shaped by human perception and capability, and how, in turn, they can extend and transform human skill, reasoning, and creativity.
Within this theoretical framework, I lead research programs that span four interrelated domains.

First, I study how computational systems can model and augment human cognitive processes such as attention, perception, and creative ideation.
Second, I examine how digital information flows through and across physical media, developing tangible interfaces and 3D-printed interactive materials that bridge virtual and material environments.

Third, I advance research in engineering education by designing making-based learning environments and computational tools that scaffold conceptual understanding and productive engagement in STEM contexts.

Finally, I analyze the implications of generative AI for creative practice—developing methods to both leverage multimodal models (e.g., text-to-image systems) in design workflows and critically assess how these systems reproduce or distort cultural, spatial, and socio-economic representations.
